    <h2>Michelangelo Antonioni: actress Monica Vitti was afraid</h2>
    <p>I could start from the waterspout, which when I saw it arrive
      soaring over the sea, shaded upwards like a very high mushroom with a hat lost
      in the clouds, I shouted to the operator to bring the camera, immediately, and shoot.</p>
    <p>But Monica Vitti was afraid, and then one of the fishermen who worked for us
      told her that he knew how to cut the columnar vortex,
      his father had confided to him the magic words in church during a Christmas night years ago.
      In fact, he pronounced them, and the waterspout vanished. </p>
    <p>And I got angry because that waterspout was exactly what I needed to make the island
      a mystery, a terrific plastic material, and the next day I wanted to fire the fisherman,
      but I couldn't do it, he put a bandage around his head to repair from the wind of the Aeolian
      a cheek swollen like a balloon, a sudden toothache that was a punishment from God,
      because the fisherman had taken his place by cutting the waterspout [...]</p>

    <h2>To us, who think we are so modern and gift mimosas. 1981: the law that abrogated fascist machismo
      and killed Donatella Colasanti</h2>
    <p>I was only one and a half years old in September 1981. I was too young to understand the historical
      significance of what was happening. My perception of women, or rather of a woman, was represented
      by my mother's love and her breast from which, probably, I was already detaching at the time.</p>

    <p>At school, teachers never mentioned this topic, and when as an adult I read so shamefully about
      the permission of the Italian law of honour killings and shotgun wedding, I was thrilled to find
      out that Article 587 of the Fascist Penal Code (approved in October 1930 on proposal of
      the Minister of Justice, Alfredo Rocco) was repealed only on September 5, 1981. Just 38 years ago!</p>

    <h2>Le Masciare - Witches from Southern Italy</h2>
    <p>The women who refused the existence of God and who were trusted because they were able to cure with healing
      herbs were called witches. They were women without supernatural gifts, but with vast knowledge and wisdom.
      For millennia, anyone who was ill was looking for a witch's remedies. Their demonisation in the Middle Ages then
      led,
      over the centuries, to various and obscure legends, including the Italian ones of the Gatta Masciare, the "envious
      cat". </p>
    <p>In the alleys of the Old City of Bari and the province, the Gatta Masciare was among the most famous witches.
      The term that would derive from Megara, one of the three great Erinyes that is female personifications
      of revenge especially towards those who strike their own family and relatives, would also come f
      rom the Greek verb Μεγαιρα, "envy". [...]
